# Face Swapping

This is one of the first machine learning projects that I made by programming my GPU to process One layer neural network.

I trained it with images of my face and a classmate. Since my GPU was not powerful I used a very low resolution Grayscale Image and
dataset was also not large because I just wanted it converge fast.


Here's a video of training in progress.

After 10 to 15 minutes of training it was able to do te task easily.

The Left most image is my image recorded from webcam, right most is the expected output after transforming my image and middle one is the
prediction after processing my image using the neural network.

The weights and biaas are stored in a csv file.
