# Face Swapping

This is one of the first machine learning projects that I made by programming my GPU to process One layer neural network.

I trained it with images of my face and a classmate. Since my GPU was not powerful I used a very low resolution Grayscale Image and
dataset was also not large because I just wanted it converge fast.


Here's a video of training in progress.

After 10 to 15 minutes of training it was able to do te task easily.
